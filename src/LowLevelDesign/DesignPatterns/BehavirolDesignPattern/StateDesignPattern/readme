what is state design pattern?
if a product has different states then we will create a interface for the state and implement it for different states.to define the operations that can be done for a product.

its used in the vending machine, like getting coffee or pepsi or coke.
if we have to design a system which majorly depends on the state of the system to perform the operations then we can use this.

like design the operations of a TV.
